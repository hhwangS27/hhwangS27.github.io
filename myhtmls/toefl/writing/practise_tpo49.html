  <h2>The ability to maintain friendships with a small number of people over a long time period of time is more important for happiness than the ability to make many new friends easily.</h2>
  <p>I do not agree with the statement.Maintaining a friendship of an old friend has nothing to do with one's happiness. Addmitedly, old friends know you better and are always more considerate, but as life is going on, you will encounter many new situations where old friends just can not help. If one is not good at making new friends, he will be hindered in the future development, and has a limit to himself.</p>
  <p>With the adventure of tons of such new technologies as high-speed railway system, cellphone and internet, people are no longer confined at one place, and you can communicate with almost anyone on our planet, in which way making new friends becomes so important. If you isolate youself to your close friends circle, you will have no chance of taking advantage of those technologies to seek new oppotunities and embrace our new world. Take myself for example. When I was at college, I am a social guy which means I spend almost all of my time on study. But the result is not good. I got little information about the things happened arround, wether a professor is great and something like that. Even though I got a high score of my classes, I lost many opportunitise, and finally choose a not that good professor as my supervisor and start my agony of my graduate study. Then I find out what is the problem, and try to be outgoing, talk with the others and I find myself knowing the world more deeply, and finally make my decition of going abroad for study, which is more propective.</p>
  <p>What's more, the old friends can not help you in your career. If you can not make friends in your own career, you won't get a boost. As a bad career always means not happy, so making new friends easily is really important in the career.</p>
  <p>With time going on, you will find you have nothing common to talk with your old friends any more. That means, you should find new friends that share the same hobbits with you.</p>
  <p>Last but not least, making friends with the friends of your relatives like your son or your wife is very important too. If you can make friends with them, you will gain a better understanding of your wife or son, which means you will have a happier family life.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, I believe the ability to make many new friends easily is really important to ones happiness. Our modern society is not like the old one, it is more open and connected. Only having many connections with the otehrs can one be more happier.</p>
